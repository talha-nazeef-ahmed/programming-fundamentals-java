### Question:

Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter a string.

The program should check whether the string contains any palindrome of length 3 (a sequence that reads the same forward and backward).

If such a substring exists, display “Palindrome exists”; otherwise, display “Palindrome does not exist.”

i.e. ("ascivicas" is string that user entered then it should print palindrome exists as "ivi" is a palindrome that exists in the user input)
