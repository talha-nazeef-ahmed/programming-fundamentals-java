new clothes and other accessories for the next school year and 1% to buy school supplies. After buying

clothes and school supplies, you use 25% of the remaining money to buy savings bonds. For each dollar

you spend to buy savings bonds, your parents spend $0.50 to buy additional savings bonds for you. Write
